	<p> The workshop on Compiler-Driven Performance has a
	particular focus on (but not limited to):
<ul>
  <li> Innovative compiler analysis, transformation, and optimization techniques </li>
  <li> Languages, compilers, and optimization techniques for multicore processors and other parallel architectures </li>
  <li> Compiling for streaming or heterogeneous hardware </li>
  <li> Dynamic compilation for high-performance and real-time environments </li>
  <li> Compilation, optimization, and analysis for dynamic languages </li>
  <li> Compilation techniques for reducing power </li>
  <li> Program safety </li>
  <li> Whole system optimization and analysis </li>
  <li> Tools and infrastructure for compiler research </li>
</ul>
  </p>

	<p>CDP invites contributions in the form of talk abstracts
	from researchers and practitioners. Each submission should
include:
<ul>
  <li> Talk title</li>
  <li> Author list with affiliations</li>
  <li> Brief abstract</li>
</ul>
Please also identify the presenter and include a 1-2 sentence
	biography. All submissions should be made through EasyChair no

	<p>CDP does not publish proceedings. Presenters are required
	to provide an electronic copy of their slides. The slides will
	be available on this website soon after the workshop. Work

	recently published or submitted for publication elsewhere is
	welcome.</p>
